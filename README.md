# NotQuiteJava-Compiler
A compiler for "NQJ", an object-oriented language.

This compiler is implemented as a portfolio project in the course "Compiler and Language-Processing Tools WS 2020\2021" of TU Kaiserslautern.
During the course we had programming exercises, with them we started our compiler implementation. At the end we had an "portfolio exam", in which we added improvements to our on hand compiler, so that it supported object-oriented programming paradigms. In the "doc" package is two documentations to find. Since the initial "Documentation" accepted as too formal and has lack of insight view of design decisions, I have written another one with name "FrielndlyDocumentation".

The language specification can be found in "NQJ-Grammar".
